The Ugly:

- Fast-paced tech has some side effects
  - Technology changes
  - Outdated information
  - Quick documentation
  - Chain effect

- Big community
  - Lots of noise
  - Tons of low-quality content
  - YouTube "React tutorial"

- Not truly reactive programming
  - Because **JS** is not reactive
```js
  let foo = 1;
  let bar = 5;
  let multiply = foo * bar;
  // multiply === 5;
  foo = 5;
  // multiply === 5;
```
