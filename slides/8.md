# The Bad: 

- Built by Facebook
  - For Facebook
  - Not all apps fit their model
  - Think about FB experience
  - Need to update the DOM a lot?

- JavaScript
  - For better or for worse
  - Not everyone's favorite language
  - Major improvements over time
  - Stigma

- Its only the **V**
  - The Model and Controller are yours to own
  - Freedom of choice, but...

- Its your job to organize your app
  - There are community standards
  - In the end, you run the show
  - Must stay disciplined
