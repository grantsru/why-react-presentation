- DOM (Document Object Model)
  - Object-oriented representation of the web page
  - *Elements* of HTML > *Nodes* of DOM
  - JS can manipulate the DOM
    - Connected by **HTML DOM** API
      - *A standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements*
- DOM is Tree-structured
  - Legible, but...
  - Massive
  - Slow to update
  - How to manage?
  - How to make efficient?
- Virtual DOM
  - An abstraction of HTML DOM, under React's control
  - Use JS to update virtual DOM
  - Compare to current snapshot
  - Update only what needs updating
  - "Diffing"
