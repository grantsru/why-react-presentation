# The Good: Virtual DOM

- DOM (Document Object Model)
  - Data representation of objects
    - Determine structure, style, and content
  - JS can manipulate the DOM
    - Connected by **HTML DOM** API
      - *A standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements*
- DOM is Tree-structured
  - Legible, but...
  - Massive
  - How to manage?
  - How to make more efficient?
- Virtual DOM
  - An abstraction of DOM, under React's control
  - Use JS to update virtual DOM
  - Compare to current snapshot
  - "Diffing" - compare previous VD snapshot to current
    - Update only what needs updating on real DOM
